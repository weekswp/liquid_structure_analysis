# structural_analysis
## Previous Code
This repository contains two pieces of software: `motifextraction\`, and `Liquid Analysis\`. The codes and comments in `motifextraction\` are the codes available at https://github.com/paul-voyles/motifextraction with minor alterations for the purpose of this work. One should fully understand the usage and codes provided at this link given that the work presented here is based on these codes and uses them heavily.

## Liquid Analysis
The `Liquid Analysis\` directory contains example usage of these codes for the analysis of simulated liquid structure in an example Cu-Zr alloy.
