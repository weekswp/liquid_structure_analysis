`clusters/` directory contains sample clusters created from original xyz file. Note that the samples are provided to show what the clusters look like but that the more than 30,000 clusters that would be created from the xyz file in the `../../Liquid Analysis/create_clusters` folder is far too many files to reasonably upload here. If you are interested in these files, please contact Porter Weeks at weekswp@wustl.edu

`cns.txt` file contains a histogram of the various coordination numbers of the clusters.
