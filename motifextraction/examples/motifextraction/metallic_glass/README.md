### ME on Metallic Glass

The code in this directory performs ME on a MG. The usage of ME is nearly identical to the intermetallic example (which you should go through before reading this code), with the exception that this code uses HT Condor to run the PPM alignments. Condor provides efficient parallelization, which is necessary because the system size is large (nearly 10,000 atoms).

The data for this example is not provided because it is too large.
