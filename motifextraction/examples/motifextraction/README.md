## Motif Extraction Examples

### Intermetallic with Five Motifs

The `intermetallic/` directory contains scripts to perform ME on a CuZr2 intermallic crystal. The model is small but contains five unique SRO structures. All code can be run locally.

All of the data for this example is contained in the `intermetallic/data/` directory.

### Metallic Glass

The motifs of a Zr-Cu-Al MG can be identified using the code in `metallic_glass/`. However, the data is large and is therefore not provided. The code uses HT Condor for parallelization and is included here to provide a more complicated (and realistic) system for analysis than the intermetallic example.
